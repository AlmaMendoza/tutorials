# 1. Introduction

Whereas MAgPIE inner core is written in GAMS, it comes with an outer layer for data handling in R. This also applies to the start of MAgPIE. 


# 2. Starting MAgPIE

## 1.1. Start Scripts 



To run the model execute `Rscript start.R` (or `source("start.R")` from within R) in the main folder of the model.
This will give you a list of available run scripts you can choose from. You can
also add your own run scripts by saving them in the folder scripts/start. To run
a single model run with settings as stated in default.cfg you can choose start
script "default". Make sure that the config file has been set correctly before
starting the model.
