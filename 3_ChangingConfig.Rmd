# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. What is configuration 

In computing, configuration files (or config files) are files used to configure the parameters and initial settings for some computer programs. In MAgPIE context, a config file applies desired settings to the model. MAgPIE users may be expected to modify config files by hand using a simple text editor as these files are human-editable plain texts. 

MAgPIE model reads its configuration file just before starting a model run. Editing these config files by hand maybe practical in cases where a user is making one run at a time but more often than not, users may have to work with a combination of different settings for the model. 

For example, a user may want to run two different trade scenarios in MAgPIE (bilateral & free-trade) and along with this, a user may also want to run  two different policy scenarios (with and without CO2 prices). In this case, the total number of runs needd is 2\*2=4. In such cases, editing config files by hand is not advisable. Here, a good programming practice would be to rather change these config files using an R script which changes the config settings in automatised manner. We'll discuss *writing your own start script* in the next session.

## 1.2. Relevence to MAgPIE 

Across Unix-like operating systems many different configuration-file formats exist, with each application or service potentially having a unique format, but there is a strong tradition of them being in human-editable plain text. Filename extensions of .cnf, .conf, .cfg, .cf or as well .ini and similar are often used. MAgPIE configuration file has a **.cfg** extension.

MAgPIE 4.1 is designed on a *modular model structure*. This means that the different *components* of the model interact with each other to act as a complete model. These components are called **modules** in MAgPIE terminology. These modules are individual entities and can be thought of as a **switch(es)** that can be turned on or off.

## 1.3. Learning objectives

The goal of this exercise is to make changes to the *default* configuration. After completion of this exercise, you'll be able to:

1. Understand how MAgPIE configuration works.
2. Change the title and number of simulation steps for your runs.
3. Select which outputs your model should generate.
4. Run the model with updated configuration.


# 2. Getting started

As stated earlier, MAgPIE configuration (or settings) can be changed by hand using a normal text editor (notepad, notepad++ etc.). It is expected that the participants of the workshop have already set-up a MAgPIE clone^[**Cloning a repository**: https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository] from the latest MAgPIE version available on GitHub^[**MAgPIE repo**: https://github.com/magpiemodel/magpie].

The folder where MAgPIE is clone should typically contain the files^[Users may or may not see the **.git** folder in their model folder depending on their *hidden files and folder* settings.] as in Figure 1.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Contents of folder where MAgPIE is cloned.", out.width = '100%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/mag-clone.png")
```

# 3. MAgPIE configuration

Users are requested to follow the following procedure in order to check the config file for MAgPIE:

1. Naviagte to the folder where you have cloned MAgPIE.
2. Look for the folder named **config**. 
3. Within this **config** folder, look for the file **default.cfg**.
4. Right click on **default.cfg** file and open it with a text editor of your choice.

The contents of **deafult.cfg** file should look like the following:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

cfg$repositories <- append(list("https://rse.pik-potsdam.de/data/magpie/public"=NULL),
                           getOption("magpie_repos"))
```

We can go through the contents of this file gradually but the description of core components from this file can be found in table 1 (as well as in the comments preceeding the respective settings in the config file).

                        ),caption = "Description of MAgPIE configuration")
```

MAgPIE is modular in structure and the various modules can be seen in the **gms** section (cfg\$gms\$\*) of the config file. These modules in MAgPIE can be turned on to a select a *module realization* (in case of multiple *module realizations*, an off setting is also available). 

# 4. Exercises

## 4.1. Changing the title

Let us try to see what is the default title of MAgPIE runs. This can be seen by looking for the following text in default.cfg file (line 17):

```{r comment=NA,eval=FALSE}
cfg$title
```

As you can see, the model is titled *default* for obvious reasons. Usually the **title** setting helps in creating the name of the **results** folder inside the **output** folder of the model. You can see this setting by searching for the following test in default.cfg file (line 619).

```{r comment=NA,eval=FALSE}
cfg$results_folder
```

*output/:title::date:* tells us that the results from a MAgPIE run are stored within the **output** folder where another sub-folder is created automatically for each run. The name of this *results folder* is a combination of **model title** and the **current date**. Usually you can use any character string for the results folder name but it is important to remember that the model execution stops if a result folder by the same name exists.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Question:

If you happen to start a MAgPIE run right now, can you guess the name of the results folder
within the output folder?
```
In order to change the default tile, users are requested to edit the setting so as to contain their **affiliation** within the quotations and save the file after editing. The default setting of title:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cfg$title <- "default"
``` 

Should be changed in the following format: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cfg$title <- "mag4workshop_<affiliation>"
``` 

For example:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
cfg$title <- "mag4workshop_PIK"
``` 

## 4.2. Changing the time step

MAgPIE, being a recursive dynamic model, can run with various levels of time steps. These time steps are usually in five year time intervals but you can also run MAgPIE with ten year time steps (or a combination thereof). 

A full set of **time-step** settings^[The time step settings are within the **gms** component of the **cfg** list.] can be found in the core sets defined in the model code under **core/sets.gms**. 

Current time-step setting can be found by looking for the following text in deafult.cfg file (line 80):

```{r, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
cfg$gms$c_timesteps
``` 

"*coup2100*" refers to time steps y1995, y2000, y2005, y2010,y2015, y2020, y2025, y2030, y2035, y2040, y2045, y2050, y2055, y2060, y2070, y2080, y2090 and y2100. 

In this exercise, we'll try to change this default time-step setting to **5** which corresponds to the years **y1995, y2000, y2010, y2020 and y2030**. Note that MAgPIE starts simlations in y1995. 

Similar to how we updated the title, you can simply delete "coup2100" from the line containing

```{r, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
cfg$gms$c_timesteps <- "coup2100"
``` 

and set it to 5

```{r, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
cfg$gms$c_timesteps <- 5
``` 

## 4.3. Changing the ouputs generated

MAgPIE is also capable of generating some stylized outputs which can be created automatically once the model run is finished. To see the current output generation settings, look for the following text in the default.cfg file (line 614):

```{r, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
cfg$output 
``` 

These ouputs^[Complete list of output R scripts can be found in **scripts/output/single** or **scripts/output/comparison** folders.] can be based on **single** run of the model or can also be **comparative** in nature where the comparison is made between two or more runs. 

The default MAgPIE configuration runs **rds_report** (to be used in appResults), **validation** (as a pdf) and **interpolation** scripts after a model run is finished. Usually, the creation of validation pdf takes quite some, generating a pdf file of about 1500 pages. 

In this exercise, we'll exclude the creation of validation pdf (after a model run) due to time constraints. To do so, you can delete "rds_report","validation","interpolation" from

```{r, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
cfg$output <- c("rds_report","validation","interpolation")
``` 

and replace it with "rds_report","interpolation"

```{r, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
cfg$output <- c("rds_report","interpolation")
``` 

## 4.4. Running the model with updated configuration

So far, we have successfully changed:

1. Title of MAgPIE runs
2. Time steps of simulation
3. Outputs desired

Now, Lets try to run the model with this updated configuration. 

To do so, windows users can go to the folder where MAgPIE was cloned and open a command line prompt there. For windows users, this can be done by typing **cmd** or **powershell** at the address bar of the folder where MAgPIE was cloned and then pressing return/enter. 

For mac users (if right click -> open terminal setting is not enabled), Head into System Preferences and select Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services. Find "New Terminal at Folder" in the settings and click the box. Now, when you're in Finder, just right-click a folder and you're shown the open to open Terminal. 

In the command prompt (or powershell or terminal) you just opened, use the following command:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
Rscript start.R
``` 

You'll now see a bunch of R scripts on your command prompt, based on which the model can be run. 

We are only focusing on the default script at the moment^[Complete list of starting R scripts can also be found in the **scripts**/**start** folder.] which uses the **default.cfg** file as starting settings. We have edited this **default.cfg** file during the course of this exercise and changed some basic settings. 

In order to start the run, Select option 1 (***default***) to tell the model that we want to make a default settings run (using the updated default.cfg) and then option 1 again (***Direct execution***). 

This will start^[To stop a run you can use the key combination **ctrl** + **c** on windows machines.] the model run on your local machine.
